    <h3>Original Team</h3>
    The original team that worked on this project was, Bobby Ludwick, Ian Davis, Manny Quinones, Griffin Bortnick, and Sean Larson. The original project pitch was delivered
    by Bobby Ludwick and Ian Davis to the Computer Science Capstone class of Spring 2020. Manny, Griffin, and Sean all joined in because of their interest in working on this project. 
    Our client was Professor Timothy Carter from the Drew University Political Science department, and the goal was to create a game that simulated fictional countries
    on a non-Earth map that could interact with each other through various means and scenarios. Throughout the semester the group developed a general base-game that had simple
    functionality, but due to the semester being affected by COVID-19, there was some time lost and the group was not able to add more to the project.
  </p>
  <p>
    The group was divided into multiple teams that would handle different aspects and parts of the game's development. Bobby worked with an alumni to help get a database running
    for login purposes, as well as creating other databases for the game's functionality. Ian and Sean worked on the actual game mechanics, as well as UI for the game. 
    Sean was also responsible for creating some aspects of the website. Manny and Griffin were the ones working on the actual map of the game, as well as functions to create a
    hexagonal grid over the map that the users would be able to interact with. Manny and Griffin would also assist the other groups when needed and when they were able. Each team
    would always lend support to one another if they needed it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Towards the end of the semester, our group realized that this project was not something that could be completed in just one semester, but it was something that could be passed
    on to other groups in the future if they ever wanted to. Our group worked on creating the materials and information needed to continue this project if another group was willing
    to take on this challenge. The project itself has a lot of moving parts that requires good communication between the teams as well as an ability to learn many different coding 
    languages. Our group spent a lot of time finding the right languages to code this project in and unfortunately spent a lot of time having to learn the languages. However, now 
    that there is a foundation that was created, it may be easier for another group to pick up where we left off. Read the information contained within the Readme.txt file to get 
    more information. We wish the best of luck to any future groups that take up the project that we started!
