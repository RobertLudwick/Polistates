  <h2>Polistates</h2>
  <p>This project is currently being developed by the following students: Bobby Ludwick, Ian Davis, Manny Quinones, Griffin Bortnick, and Sean Larson. <br>
  The goal of this project is to create a game to assist in the learning process of students in an International Relations class. The game will allow students <br>
to control states and choose how they want to interact with other states on the map. As students play, they will be presented with real world scenarios that will prompt <br>
them to choose how they want to handle each scenario. Students will also have to manage their resources for their state by controlling tiles on the map, which have <br>
different resources on each tile. </p>

<p>As of now, the project is still in it's building phase, and we are working towards having a testable product in the coming weeks. If you are interested in testing <br>
  our product, please go to the "Beta Testing" page and fill out the respective form.
