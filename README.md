# Polistates
Polistates is a strategy game being developed as part of our Drew University Computer Science capstone project
 for Spring of 2020. Our client is a professor in the Political Science department, as the game will be used to reinforce International Relations concepts.

## Continuing this project
This project is intended to be worked on by multiple teams over the course of multiple semesters as this project is too ambitous to be finished in 3 months while the team is taking other classes. Detailed below is setup intructions and advice for future teams working on this project.

### Workspace Setup

Clone this repository

then execute the command

node app.js

The page should be running on localhost:3000

This project is optomized for Heroku if you want to put it on the internet

### What we accomplished

### Suggestions for the next team

#### New Features

Add additional scenarios (Below are some possible examples)
	
	- Climate Change (Natural Disasters)
	
	- Loss of resources (Natural Disasters, Pest infestations)
	
	- Human rights violations
	
	- Terrorism
	
	- Overpopulation
	
	- Border conflics
	
	- Annexing neighboring cities and countries controlled by A.I. 
	
	- International Space Station
	
Add a leaderboard and/or competitive stats for the players
Add a mini globe in the corner that will allow players to easily move, or rotate the map

#### Changes to existing ones

Set up transparent and interactice hexagonal grid.
	- Can find code for it online, just need to figure out the implementation aspect.
Add new types of terrain to the map, and if necessary, change existing terrain.
	- Alternatively, add a way to randomize terrain between all the islands
Instead of a set number of turns, have the game choose a random number between a set minimum and a set maximum.

#### Major Changes

Remake in React JS. While a majority of the code could be kept in this change, map.js would need to be rebuilt, and the file structure would change. This change would make the map easier to build though and the end result would likely look better.
